Statistics is all about the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. Statistics is used everywhere from opinion polling in politics to predicting the prices of assets. There are two main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. 1.2 Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics describes or summarises data that have been collected. Measures of central tendency such as (mean, median and the mode) and measures of dispersion (range, interquartile range and standard deviation) are the most important tools. 1.3 Inferential Statistics Inferential statistical is used to make prediction about a population using information gathered about a sample. Inferential statistics involves hypothesis testing and regression analysis.

We can further categorise quantitative data as being continuous or discrete. Discrete data involves whole numbers that can’t be divided because of what they represent (number of people in a class, number of cars owned). The number of people in a class cannot be 10.5 or 3.14. It must be a whole number because people are not divisible. Continuous data can be divided and measured to some number of decimal places (height, weight, speed in miles per hour). A person’s height can be any number (provided it lies within the range of possible human heights) and can be reported to any number of decimal places (150cm or 150.1cm or 150.12cm) depending on how accurate the measurement tool is. There are also different levels of measurement. 2.2 Levels of Measurement The levels of measurement describe how precisely variables are recorded. The different levels of measurement limit which statistics can be used to summarise data and which inferential statistics can be performed. These levels are: Nominal Ordinal Interval Ratio 2.2.1 Nominal Nominal data is a type of data that is used to label variables. It can be categorised but not ranked (eye colour and gender for instance). The values grouped into these categories have no meaningful order. It is not possible to form a meaningful hierarchy of gender or eye colour. Figure 2.1: Eye colour is an example of nominal data. The only measure of central tendency used with nominal data is the mode. 2.2.2 Ordinal Ordinal data is another type of qualitative data that groups variables into descriptive categories. The categories used for ordinal data are ordered in some kind of hierarchical scale although the distance between those categories may be uneven or even unknown. Figure 2.2: The highest level of educational attainment has a heirarchical scale but the distance between categories is unclear. Ordinal variables often include ratings about opinions that can be categorised (strongly agree, agree, don’t know, disagree, strongly disagree). The descriptive statistics which can be used with ordinal data are the mode and the median. Ordinal data can also be described with a measure of dispersion, namely, range. 2.2.3 Interval Interval data is a type of quantitative data that groups variables into categories. Values can be ordered and separated using an equal measure of distance. An example of interval level data is temperature data recorded in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The values on either scale are ordered and separated using an equal measure of distance (the distances between notches on a thermometer are always equally spaced). Figure 2.3: Temperature in Celsius is interval data. The values are ordered and separated by an equal interval. The distance between 0°C and 1°C is the same as the distance between 2°C and 3°C. Mathematical operations can be carried out on this type of data, for instance, subtracting one value from another to find the difference. Interval data lacks a true zero. True zero indicates a lack of whatever is being measured. The Celsius scale doesn’t qualify as having a true zero since the zero point in a thermometer is arbitrary. When the Celsius scale was first created by Anders Celsius 0°C was selected to match the boiling point of water and a value of 100 °C was the freezing point of water. The scale was later reversed. Thermometers measure heat and at 0°C there is still heat, maybe not a great deal of it but heat is still measurable meaning 0°C is not a true zero. The thermodynamic Kelvin Scale has a true zero - where particles have no motion and can become no colder (there is a true absence of heat). A range of descriptive statistics can be used to describe interval data. The measures of central tendency applicable to interval data are the mode, median and the mean. The measures of dispersion applicable to interval data are the range, standard deviation and the variance. 2.2.4 Ratio Ratio data is a form of quantitative data. It measures variables on a continuous scale with an equal distance between adjacent values (weight, height). Ratio data has a true zero. Ratio data is the most complex of the four data types. Figure 2.4: The scatterplot above shows metabolic rate plotted against body weight (kg). These are examples of ratio data. Ratio data can be analysed with descriptive statistics including the mode, median and mean. Range, standard deviation, variance and the coefficient of variation can all be used to describe the dispersion of ratio data.

Frequency Table Grade Frequency A 15 B 20 C 25 D 21 E 14 The total of all frequencies so far in a frequency distribution is the cumulative frequency. It is the ‘running total’ of frequencies. Cumulative Frequency Table Grade Frequency Cumulative Frequency A 15 15 B 20 35 C 25 60 D 21 81 E 14 95 The relative frequency is the ratio of the category frequency to the total number of outcomes. For grade A, the relative frequency is: \\[ \\frac{15}{15+20+25+21+14}=0.16. \\] The table can be extended to include the relative frequency. Relative Frequency Table Grade Frequency Relative Frequency A 15 0.16 B 20 0.21 C 25 0.26 D 21 0.22 E 14 0.15 The relative frequency can be reported as a percentage by multiplying the values by 100%. For grade A, the relative frequency reported as a percentage is: 100% x 0.16 = 16%. 4.2 Measures of Central Tendency Measures of central tendency help find the middle, or the average, of a data set.The measures of central tendency are the mean, median and mode. 4.2.1 Mean The mean is the sum of the recorded values divided by the number of values recorded. 4.2.1.1 Example Find the mean of this list of numbers: \\[ 2, 3, 3, 4, 20.\\] \\[ \\textrm{Mean} = \\frac{\\textrm{Sum of recorded values}}{\\textrm{Number of values recorded}},\\] \\[ \\textrm{Mean} = \\frac{\\textrm{2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 20}}{\\textrm{5}},\\] \\[ \\textrm{Mean} = \\frac{\\textrm{32}}{\\textrm{5}},\\] \\[ \\textrm{Mean} = 6.4.\\] 4.2.2 Median The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of values. If there are an odd number of values the median is simply the middle value. For an even number of values there will be two values in the center. Those values are summed and divided by two. The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers that might skew the average of the values. 4.2.2.1 Example Find the median of this list of numbers: \\[ 2, 3, 3, 4, 20.\\] There are 5 values listed in ascending order and the middle value is the third value in the list so the median is 3. Note: In the previous example the mean was 6.4. It was skewed by the outlier (20). The median remains closer to what might be considered to be the middle of the data set. 4.2.2.2 Example Find the median of this list of numbers: \\[ 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 8, 7, 1.\\] The list should be sorted: \\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8. \\] There are an even number of values so there will be two middle values. The middle values are 4 and 4. Sum them and divide by two to get the median: 4. 4.2.3 Mode The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often. It is the value that is most likely to be sampled. There can be multiple modes or no modes. 4.2.3.1 Example Find the mode of this list of numbers: \\[ 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4.\\] A simple way to find the mode is to make a frequency table with the unique values on the left hand side and their frequency on the right hand side. We can tally up how many times each number occurs. Whichever has the greatest frequency is our mode. Frequency Table Value Frequency 1 1 2 3 3 2 4 1 The mode is 2. 4.2.3.2 Example Find the mode of this list of numbers: \\[ 7, 3, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 8, 5.\\] Frequency Table Value Frequency 3 3 4 1 5 3 6 1 7 1 8 1 This is bimodal, it has two modes, 3 and 5. 4.2.3.3 Example Find the mode of this list of numbers: \\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\\] Frequency Table Value Frequency 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 Every value is unique and occurs only once so this data has no mode. 4.3 Using Excel It is useful to calculate descriptive statistics by hand for understanding but for larger data sets it is not always possible to arrange data and perform calculations by hand. Excel has a number of functions designed to perform descriptive statistics. Frequency =FREQUENCY(start:end,bins_array) The frequency() function will return a frequency table describing your data. It takes two arguments, the first being the array of values and the second being an array describing the upper boundary of the bins used. Average =AVERAGE(start:end) The mean is calculated using the average() function. There are several other functions relating to means: geomean(), harmean() and trimmean(). Take care not to use these as they are quite different from calculating the mean that has been described here. Median =MEDIAN(start:end) The median is calculated using the median() function. Mode =MODE.SNGL(start:end) =MODE.MULT(start:end) There are several functions for calculating the mode: mode(), mode.sngl() and mode.mult(). mode() was used in Excel 2007 and may still appear as an option in some versions of Excel. mode.sngl() will return one mode and mode.mult() will return multiple modes (if there are multiple modes). Neither mode() nor mode.sngl() will warn you if there are multiple modes so mode.mult() is usually the safest option. 4.3.1 Example In the example below, the variable name is in cell A1 and the values are in cells A2 to A18. To calculate the average, type “=AVERAGE(A2:A18)” in another cell. It doesn’t matter which cell but in this example A19 has been used. Press enter to return the value.

The range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation are all measures of dispersion and they describe how far apart data points lie from one another and the center of a distribution. 4.4.1 Range The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values and is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. 4.4.1.1 Example Calculate the range for the following set of numbers: \\[ 23, 42, 75, 19, 74. \\] First, arrange the values in ascending order: \\[ 19, 23, 42, 74, 75. \\] The maximum value is 75 and the minimum is 19. \\[ \\textrm{Range}= 75 - 19, \\] \\[ \\textrm{Range} = 56.\\] 4.4.2 Interquartile Range The interquartile range (IQR) describes the spread of the middle half of a distribution. How the interquartile range is calculated depends on whether there are an even or an odd number of values in a dataset. For an even number of values the dataset in split half. The medians for the two new subsets of data are calculated. The positive difference of those medians is the interquartile range. For an odd number of values either the inclusive or the exclusive method of finding the interquartile range must be used. Tree diagram showing process of deciding how to calculate the IQR The algorithm for the exclusive method is detailed below: Arrange the data in numeric order. Remove the median and split the data about its center. Find the medians of the two newly appended subsets of data. Calculate the difference. The algorithm for the inclusive method is detailed below: Arrange the data in numeric order. Remove the median and split the data about its center. Append the two new subsets of data with the median. Find the medians of the two newly appended subsets of data. Calculate the difference. Click on the slides below to see some examples. 4.4.3 Variance and Standard Deviation The standard deviation describes to what extent a set of numbers lie apart (their spread). It is the square root of variance which is also an indicator of the spread of values. Variance To calculate the variance: 1. Start by finding the mean of the values in the dataset. 2. Find the difference between each recorded value and the mean. 3. Square those differences. 4. Sum the squared differences. 5. Divide the sum by the number of values recorded for population variance or the sum of the number of values minus 1 for sample variance. Standard Deviation Taking square root of the variance corrects for the fact that all the differences were squared, resulting in the standard deviation. The plot below shows three distributions of values, each with a mean of 30 but with different standard deviations. In statistics there is a rule called the empirical rule that states that 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean, respectively.
